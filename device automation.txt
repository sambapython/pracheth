Device test automation. To test any device we have to execute the commands.
The device may be in local, or it may be in remote.
If the device in local, then we have to follow the below approach to automate the command execution.
 
import os
os.system(" any command which you want to execute")

This approach will not show an out for any command. for example.

os.system("ls -ltr") will show the output, but if we want analyze this output, we could not store that in any variable.
 that's why we need to use subprocess module.

import subprocess
res = subprocess.check_output("ls -ltr")

The command output available now in res variable.

If the device in remote, then we have to use paramiko module if the device has linux os. we have to use telnetlib to 
connect to the windows os devices.
telnet lib: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_network_programming/python_telnet.htm
paramiko: https://github.com/sambapython/python/blob/master/pmk.py

before connecting to the remote device by one of these two modules, make sure that the corresponding services(telnet/ssh) running in remote machines.

Now a days every device comeup with a API. application programing interface.

The devices which providing APIs, they will provide a API documentation.

For example look at this site https://reqres.in/
